# Basic Dice Rolling Project

This Python script allows users to simulate rolling two dice. It runs in a loop, prompting the user to roll the dice (y) or quit (n). Random values from 1 to 6 are generated for each die. The loop continues until the user chooses to exit. Invalid inputs are handled with a simple message.
