#Basic Data Analysis and Cleaning Project
This project focuses on performing basic data exploration, cleaning, and transformation tasks using Python. The goal is to understand the structure of the dataset, handle missing values, and prepare the data for further analysis or visualization.

##Tools Used
Python (pandas, numpy) – Primary tools for data cleaning and transformation

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive environment to run and document the process

Matplotlib / Seaborn – For basic data visualization

CSV File – Source data for the analysis

 ##Data Cleaning and Analysis Tasks Performed
1. Data Import
Loaded the dataset from a CSV file using pandas.read_csv()

2. Initial Data Exploration
Used .head(), .info(), and .describe() to understand:

Data types

Basic statistics

Null values

Unique values per column

3. Handling Missing Values
Identified missing values using .isnull().sum()

Applied different strategies like:

Dropping rows with too many missing values

Filling missing values using fillna() with appropriate default or computed values

4. Column Renaming and Reordering
Renamed certain columns for clarity using .rename()

Reordered columns for better readability

5. Data Type Conversion
Converted columns to more appropriate data types (e.g., strings to dates, floats to integers where applicable)

6. Basic Visualizations (if included)
Created simple plots using matplotlib and seaborn to:

Identify distributions

Spot outliers

Understand correlations

##Final Outcome
The cleaned dataset is now:

Free of unnecessary missing values

Well-structured with appropriate column names and data types

Ready for further analysis, modeling, or visualization
